# Building Fast Queries on a CSV

### Project completed as part of Dataquest's Data Engineering path.

----------------------

## Introduction
This project is a way to answer a few business questions about an inventory of an online laptop store. 

Our goal is create a class that represent the inventory and do this in an efficient way. The methods in this class will implement the queries that we want to answer about the inventory and we'll preprocess that data to make those queries run faster. Examples of queries are:
* Given a laptop id, find the corresponding data.
* Given an amount of money, find whether there are two laptops whose total price is that given amount.
* Identify all laptops whose price falls within a given budget.

It should be noted that the data set is a csv file adapted from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ionaskel/laptop-prices) by changed IDs and prices made integers.
